_This project is in the earliest stages of infancy._


`lspsonnet` is a [language
server](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for
[Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/).

Very few LSP features are currently implemented and those
implementations are only partially complete (and probably poorly
implemented; I'm learning Go with this project so PRs of all kinds are
welcome).
